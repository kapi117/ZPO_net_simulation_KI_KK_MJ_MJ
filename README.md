# Factory Net Simulation

Project developed as part of ZPO (Advanced Object-Oriented Programming) course at AGH UST. It has been a complex project, requiring us to use many advanced skills we've learned about C++ language and OOP. Its final version passed all the tests, which wasn't that common among our peers, and finally we've received 5.0 grade.
